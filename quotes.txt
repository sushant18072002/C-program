HAPPY{
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.#}
ALIVE{
When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.#}
GOOD{
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.#}
OPEN{
The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.#}
LOVE{
I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with you.#}
INTERESTED{
Interest is the spur of the people, but glory that of great souls. Invention is the talent of youth, and judgment of age.#}
POSITIVE{
You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.#}
STRONG{
If fear is cultivated it will become stronger, if faith is cultivated it will achieve mastery.#}
ANGRY{
Discussion is an exchange of knowledge; an argument an exchange of ignorance.#}
DEPRESSED{
If you know someone who’s depressed, please resolve never to ask them why. Depression isn’t a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather.#}
CONFUSED{
The most confused we ever get is when we're trying to convince our heads of something our heart knows is a lie.#}     
HELPLESS{
You have the power to heal your life, and you need to know that. We think so often that we are helpless, but we're not. We always have the power of our minds…Claim and consciously use your power.#}
INDIFFERENT{
We live in an age of technology and science that demands proof, and yet we desire mystery. But when God gives us mystery, we seek to destroy it by gross indifference or childish reasoning.#}
AFRAID{
Fears are educated into us, and can, if we wish, be educated out.#}
HURT{
Truth is everybody is going to hurt you: you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for.#}
SAD{
We must understand that sadness is an ocean, and sometimes we drown, while other days we are forced to swim.#}
